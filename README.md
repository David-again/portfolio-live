### Read this first!
- This is the source code for my (single-page) Online Portfolio.  It provides a feel for my coding style.
- Developed (and deployed) using webpack, the page showcases my dev skills, as well as my ongoing and completed projects.
- The plan is to update with links to my newer projects as they are pushed online upon completion.  Please check back soon! ðŸ˜Ž

**2022 addition:** 
- [x] Update content
- [ ] Expand into a ***multi-page website***, showcasing my multi-disciplinary career profile:
    * Software Development
    * Aviation Career (Airplanes, Helicopters and Drones)
    * Mortgage brokering in Ontario, Canada
- [ ] Use ReactJS for the additional pages
- [ ] Base all pages on a template (same header/navbar, and footer)... perhaps with Python/Flask.

## 0. Package contents
This package should consist of at least the following items:
Filename | Description
-|- 
`"README.md"` | This read-me file, providing a usage overview
`"package.json"` | Holds metadata relevant to the project; Useful for managing dependencies, scripts, version, etc.
`"\src\"` | Source code folder containing all the HTML files, at the top level, while others are grouped into respective folders (e.g. `"css"`, `"images"`, etc )
`"webpack.config.js"` | Used to configure and extend Webpack's basic functionality.

**Note:**

The ReactJS components in this project are located under `"\src\scripts\components\"` folder.

## 1. How to run - General information
To install dependencies: 
`npm install`
This adds the node_modules folder.

To run development server (dev environment):
`npm run dev`

The project runs on port 3000.  i.e:  
`http://0.0.0.0:3000`

See the `package.JSON` for additional details.

A few VSCode extensions may be required for linting.  These include (not an exhaustive list):
- PostCSS Language Support
- 

## 2. Input file format

There are no input files at this time.

## 3. OutputÂ 

There will be a DB used to store data collected from the feedback form.  Currently, Netlify's feedback functionality is being used for this.

## 4. Test Cases
N/A 

[comment]: <> (Please consult the `ReleaseTestPlan.md` for details about testing and creating/substituting test cases.)

## 5. Performance
N/A 

## 6. Limitations
N/A 

## 7. Future work

See the section titled **"2022 addition"** above.

## 8. Comments and Conclusion
This began as a project to put into practice the web development skills I had learned during several bootcamps in the process of transitioning from flying helicopters professionally, to the I.T. industry as a developer.

It will continue to evolve in two ways: 
- The content will continue to grow.
- The tech-stack used may change.

>Thank you for taking the time to review my work.  I hope to hear from you soon, eager to answer any questions!
